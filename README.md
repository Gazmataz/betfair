Installation
===========

This library can be found on [Packagist](https://packagist.org/packages).
The recommended way to install this is through [composer](http://getcomposer.org).

Run these commands to install composer, the library and its dependencies:

```bash
$ curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
$ php composer.phar require erlangb/betfair-php:dev-master
```

Or edit `composer.json` and add:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "erlangb/betfair": "dev-master"
    }
}
```

**Protip:** you should browse the
[`erlangb/betfair`](https://packagist.org/packages/erlangb/betfair)
page to choose a stable version to use, instead of dev-master

And install dependencies:

```bash
$ curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
$ php composer.phar install
```

Now you can add the autoloader, and you will have access to the library:

```php
<?php

require 'vendor/autoload.php';
```

If you don't use neither **Composer** nor a _ClassLoader_ in your application, just require the provided autoloader:

```php
<?php

require_once 'src/autoload.php';
```

Usage
======

Obtain an APP_KEY
------------
To use this library you have to obtain an APP_KEY from [Betfair](https://developer.betfair.com/)

The simple usage
------------
**Protip:**  With the __simple usage__ you can have access to the already existing helpers. Please feel free to contribute to this library by adding more helpers.

The first step is setting up the library and obtain the **Betfair** object.
The **Betfair** object has to built up with a *BetfairClient*, *BetfairContainer* and an *Adapter*.

We need to build these objects for the library to be customizable, if needed.
In the __how to customize__ section you will be explained how to do it.

```php
<?php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';
use Betfair\Credential;
use Betfair\Dependency\BetfairContainer;
use Betfair\Betfair;
use Betfair\Client\BetfairClient;
use Betfair\Client\JsonRpcClient;
use Betfair\Adapter\ArrayAdapter;

$credential = new Credential("APP_KEY", "BETFAIR_USERNAME", 'BETFAIR_PWD');
$container = new BetfairContainer();
$betfairClient = new BetfairClient($credential, new JsonRpcClient());

$betfair = new Betfair($betfairClient, $container, new ArrayAdapter());
```
With the **Betfair** object you can access to the API model to execute some query.
For example, considering the Betfair __Event__ API, you can access to the relative object model by typing:
```php
$betfairEvent = $betfair->getBetfairEvent();
```
Following an helper to access the list of events API by typing:
```php
$result = $betfairEvent->getAllEventFilteredByEventTypeIds(array(1));
```
The result object  is a list of betfair events with event type = 1 (Soccer)

The custom usage
------------
With the simple usage you can use the already existing query helper. 
If you want to run a more specific API query, that is not present on the helpers, you can use a custom query  by using the **GenericBetfair** object.

```php
$generic = $betfair->getBetfairGeneric();
$filter = $betfair->getContainer()->get('betfair.market.filter.factory')->create();
$filter->setEventTypeIds(array(1));
$to = new \DateTime('now');
$from = new \DateTime('now + 3 days');
$filter->setMarketStartTime(new \Betfair\Model\TimeRange($to, $from));
$param = $betfair->getContainer()->get('betfair.param.filter.factory')->create($filter);
$result = $generic->executeCustomQuery($param, 'listEvents'); // or $generic->executeCustomQuery($param, Event::METHOD);  
```

This snippet is similar to the simple usage one with a little difference in the filter object, where we have added a constraint that filters the events into a specific time range.

To execute a custom query we need two important objects: 

*   *MarketFilter* 
*   *Param*

By using the simple container, we can access to the factories MarketFactory and ParamFactory. 
This factory creates a Param and a MarketFilter object. With this two objects we can built a custom Filter and a custom Param and passing it to the __executeCustomQuery__ method.

Todo
===========
The library is actually "in dev" state and a lot of things to be done. 
*   Enabling guzzle library
*   Implements more "Betfair object" to extend the API wrapping
*   Add more PHPspec test
*   PHPspec test refactoring
*   Guzzle client side caching system
